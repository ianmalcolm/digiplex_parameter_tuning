# Round0

Datasetset Round0 is provided by SMU. 100 Adjacency matrices and results from DA are included in this dataset. The adjacency matrices are reportedly generated by the "graph_gen.py" in this directory.

## Issue

The adjacency matrix of the graphs do not meet ***triangular inequality***. I cannot find the coordinates of the vertices, which is required as an input for some Graph convolutional networks. Therefore, this dataset could only be used in the baseline methods.
